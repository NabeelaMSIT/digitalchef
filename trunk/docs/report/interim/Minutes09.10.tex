\paragraph{Issues discussed}

\begin{itemize}
	\item There was a slight misunderstanding of how to present the milestone chart. After discussing this with Dr Greensmith we now understand that as long as we understand the milestone chart thats all that really matters. 
	\item Since we are using Django to build the database all validation is included within the design.
	\item Ensure we have set deadlines for all tasks. 
	\item Management heads for each section of the project.This includes documentation, quality assurance, technical, design and management.  
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{To do}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Begin to think about design, either the website or the database.  
	\item Begin to look at Django.  
\end{enumerate}
