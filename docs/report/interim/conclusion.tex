The success of version 1 of our protype within the set deadlines is a testament to the group's
dedication to the project. This achievement also provides valuable affirmation to having set a reasonable timeplan and project 
specification. Having overcome the initial hurdle of acquiring a feel of the technologies involved,
the group can look forward to expanding version 1 to versions 2 and 3.
