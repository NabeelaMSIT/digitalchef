The aim of this project is to develop a software kitchen assistant tool. This tool must be able to provide recipes which match a supplied list of available ingredients. This is similar to the BBC's recipe search\footnote{\url{http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/}} (Fig~\ref{fig:bbc_food}), but is not constrained to just three search items. This also involves making recommendations and provides us with an avenue to make use of the collaborative filtering technology, which is the process of evaluating recipes through the opinions of
other people. The recipe evaluation allows us to provide users with recipes they are likely to enjoy. Additionally, the recipe database can be community maintained, and aspects of social networking can be implemented to encourage user participation. The main draw of the project lies in its inherent flexibility, which extends from the plethora of expansion decisions which can be made to enhance user experience.
