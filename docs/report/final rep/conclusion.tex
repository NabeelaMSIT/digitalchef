The success of version 1 of our protype within the set deadlines is a testament to the group's
dedication to the project. This achievement also provides valuable affirmation to having set a reasonable timeplan and project 
specification.

Version 2 was met before the deadline, and there was time to implement a few extra features from the ``Ideal System'' Version 3 specification. Although it was a very challenging specification, the group had ambitious plans for further developments that could be made, and the structure of the project is designed to be extensible to allow such future features to be implemented. The project already surpasses many commercial services in its more advanced features, and with more development time we believe that it could lead the field.
